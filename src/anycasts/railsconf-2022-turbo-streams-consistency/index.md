This episode is a spin-off to the RailsConf 2022 talk ["The pitfalls of realtime-ification"][talk] and is dedicated to a particular pitfall—**consistency**. We're going to demonstrate how to make Turbo Streams reliable and make a switch from the "at-most once" to the "exactly-once" delivery guarantee.

In the end of the episode, we provide a quick overview of the upcoming AnyCable feature—**streams history support**.
