In this episode, we explore [Fly.io][fly] capabilities in deploying Rails real-time applications:

- Deploying a _pure_ Rails Action Cable application to Fly.
- Load-testing _Flying_ Action Cable with k6 and [xk6-cable][].
- Deploying [RPC-less][rpc-less-post] version of AnyCable and load-testing it.
- Adding RPC server to the equation with just a couple of configuration changes.
- Exporting [AnyCable metrics][anycable-metrics] to [fly-metrics.io][fly-metrics].

**Benchmark results**

- Action Cable server (single-worker Puma) crashed due to out-of-memory at about **700 concurrent connections**.
- AnyCable (RPC-less) passed **2700 concurrent connections** and consumed only a half of the available RAM (~120MB).

**Errata**:

- Getting an app's Ruby version from the Gemfile has been fixed in the recent `flyctl` versions (see [issue](https://github.com/superfly/flyctl/issues/1242))

- Redis connections termination is intentional and has nothing with load-testing. See [the Fly docs](https://fly.io/docs/rails/getting-started/#patching-action-cable-to-handle-redis-timeouts)
