          | AnyCable is dramatically more efficient in RAM and CPU usage than Rails’ Action Cable, right out of the box. It transforms your Rails application’s real-time performance, making it on par with Go, Elixir, and Node.js-based solutions—so you won’t have to rewrite a thing, and can focus on implementing business logic instead.
        .slide--text
          | AnyCable is here to make your application resilient during peak loads and make your real-time features scale without spending a fortune on infrastructure.

        h3 Better real-time experience
        .slide--text
          | Real-time user experience is the battleground today. With AnyCable you win continuously as your app scales.
        .slide--text
          | If wait times are more than a second or two, you can no longer call your application “real-time”. With AnyCable, this is no longer a problem.

        h3 Additional features
        .slide--text
          | AnyCable provides features out of the box that are missing in Action Cable, but are required for many production installations, including analytics, Prometheus integration, disconnect-less deployments, non-Rails applications support, and more.
        .slide--text
          | Moreover, it is designed to be easily extendable, and we are ready to tune and expand AnyCable to fit your needs.
